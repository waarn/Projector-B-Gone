# Projector-B-Gone
Turn off and freeze Epson projectors and Newline smart boards. Also added is code to turn off just about any TV in NA or EU. (Code from Ken Shirriff)
### Setup
1. Download the repo
2. Extract repo
3. Open repo in arduino (Move to new directory)
4. Upload to your board
5. Look in designs folder for desired circuit setup
### Quick Tips
* 3 flashes is NA, 6 is EU
* Arduino will ask to move files to new directory, allow this.
* When doing freezing the code will be sent 10x, this may toggle the setting to combat this simply point away after freezing/unfreezing
